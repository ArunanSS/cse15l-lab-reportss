- In this code what was initially called was the Handler, Handle Request and Chat Server 
- Initially what happened we can see is that input value is set to jPolitz. The text is set to hello. And currently this is stored in the message history. The relevant arguments are, url that is stored in handle request and the main method stores the local host port, and all the messages that are typed.
- In this we can see that it is stored. But it is message history

- Similar to the actual code the methods that are being ussed is Handler, HandleRequest, and chatServer
- Relevant argument for the handleRest is the url that is being passed. For main method its the port of the local host that we are using. As for messages, it is what we as the user type and paste
- The value that is changed in the server is that multiple changes that we make to the url is updated there. First it is saved then the next line is printed.

## Part 3
I learned some new things over the week 2 and week 3 labs. What interested me most was how we learned about webservers and the commands that went with it. Building and running servers, was pretty cool. I really liked it when we shared all of our data on the doc, which let us access other webservers. The task of building the simple model of the search engine, was difficult but taught me cool things as well.
